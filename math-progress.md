# Math Learning — Progress Log

> This file is my long-term memory of what we've covered. I READ it at the start of every
> session and UPDATE it at the end. Newest entries at the top of the Session Log.

## Skill Ledger
- **Real numbers (intro)** — taught (awaiting student's exercises). Covers: the number
  systems ℕ⊂ℤ⊂ℚ⊂ℝ, decimal test for rationality, field axioms, order + absolute value +
  triangle inequality + intervals, proof that √2 is irrational, completeness (least upper
  bound) and density of ℚ in ℝ.

## Current Focus
Topic 1 of `math-topic.md`: **Real Numbers**. Notebook delivered; student to study it and
complete the 20 exercises. Next topic in queue: **2. Algebra Essentials**.

## Known Weak Spots (auto-revisit these)
- _none recorded yet — first lesson just delivered; assess from the student's exercise
  answers (especially the proof exercises 16–20)._

### Session 1 — 2026-06-19
- **Topic taught:** Real Numbers (topic 1 of `math-topic.md`). First real lesson.
- **Notebook created:** `notebooks/01-real-numbers.ipynb` (20 cells; verified it runs
  end-to-end with `uv run jupyter nbconvert --execute`).
- **Environment:** Set up `uv` project (`pyproject.toml`), added numpy, sympy,
  matplotlib, jupyterlab. Created `notebooks/` folder.
- **What went well:** N/A yet (first session — no prior recall quiz possible).
- **Mistakes / misconceptions to revisit:** none yet; collect from exercise answers.
- **Homework given:** 20 exercises in the notebook (warm-up → proofs). Key proofs:
  #16 rational+irrational is irrational, #17 √3 irrational, #18 reverse triangle
  inequality, #20 sup of {x²<2} = √2 via completeness.
- **Next session plan:** Quiz briefly on √2-irrationality proof and the decimal test.
  Then start **Algebra Essentials** (topic 2): notebook `02-algebra-essentials.ipynb`.
